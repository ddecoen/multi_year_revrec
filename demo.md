# ASC 606 Multi-Obligation Revenue Recognition Calculator - Demo Examples

## Overview

This calculator handles complex ASC 606 scenarios with three distinct performance obligations:
1. **Initial Software Installation** (14.29%) - One-time service recognized in Year 1
2. **Software License** (57.14%) - Point in time recognition in Year 1  
3. **Technical Support** (28.57%) - Over time recognition across contract term

The allocation percentages are based on relative standalone selling prices (SSP) as required by ASC 606.

## ASC 606 Five-Step Framework Implementation

### Step 1: Identify the Contract
- Software implementation and support agreement
- Clear deliverables and payment terms
- Enforceable rights and obligations

### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations

**Three Distinct Performance Obligations:**

1. **Initial Software Installation**
   - One-time implementation service
   - Satisfied at point in time (when installation complete)
   - Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits

2. **Software License**  
   - Right to use software for contract term
   - Satisfied at point in time (when access granted)
   - Customer controls the license

3. **Technical Support Services**
   - Ongoing support throughout contract term
   - Satisfied over time (as services provided)
   - Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits

### Step 3: Determine Transaction Price
- Total contract amount
- Fixed consideration (no variable components in this example)

### Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price

**Based on Relative Standalone Selling Prices:**

- Installation SSP: $150,000
- License SSP: $600,000  
- Support SSP: $300,000
- **Total SSP: $1,050,000**

**Allocation Percentages:**
- Installation: $150,000 ÷ $1,050,000 = **14.29%**
- License: $600,000 ÷ $1,050,000 = **57.14%**
- Support: $300,000 ÷ $1,050,000 = **28.57%**

### Step 5: Recognize Revenue
- **Installation & License:** Recognized in Year 1 (point in time)
- **Support:** Recognized ratably over contract term (over time)

## Example 1: Standard Implementation Contract

**Contract Details:**
- Total Contract Price: $1,000,000
- Contract Term: 3 years
- SSP Values: Installation $150K, License $600K, Support $300K

**Revenue Allocation:**
- Installation: $1,000,000 × 14.29% = $142,900
- License: $1,000,000 × 57.14% = $571,400  
- Support: $1,000,000 × 28.57% = $285,700

**Revenue Recognition Schedule:**

| Year | Installation | License | Support | Total | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | $142,900 | $571,400 | $95,233 | $809,533 | $809,533 |
| 2 | $0 | $0 | $95,233 | $95,233 | $904,766 |
| 3 | $0 | $0 | $95,234 | $95,234 | $1,000,000 |

**Support Breakdown:**
- Annual: $95,233
- Monthly: $7,936

## Example 2: Large Enterprise Deal

**Contract Details:**
- Total Contract Price: $2,100,000 (2x the SSP total)
- Contract Term: 3 years
- Same SSP ratios apply

**Revenue Allocation:**
- Installation: $2,100,000 × 14.29% = $300,090
- License: $2,100,000 × 57.14% = $1,199,940
- Support: $2,100,000 × 28.57% = $599,970

**Revenue Recognition Schedule:**

| Year | Installation | License | Support | Total | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | $300,090 | $1,199,940 | $199,990 | $1,700,020 | $1,700,020 |
| 2 | $0 | $0 | $199,990 | $199,990 | $1,900,010 |
| 3 | $0 | $0 | $199,990 | $199,990 | $2,100,000 |

## Example 3: Five-Year Extended Support

**Contract Details:**
- Total Contract Price: $1,500,000
- Contract Term: 5 years (extended support)
- Same SSP allocation percentages

**Revenue Allocation:**
- Installation: $1,500,000 × 14.29% = $214,350
- License: $1,500,000 × 57.14% = $857,100
- Support: $1,500,000 × 28.57% = $428,550

**Revenue Recognition Schedule:**

| Year | Installation | License | Support | Total | Cumulative |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | $214,350 | $857,100 | $85,710 | $1,157,160 | $1,157,160 |
| 2-5 | $0 | $0 | $85,710 | $85,710 | +$85,710/year |

## SSP Determination Methods

### Observable SSP (Preferred)
- **Direct Observable:** Company sells installation, license, and support separately
- **Historical Data:** Past transactions for similar services
- **Published Rates:** Documented pricing for individual components

### Estimated SSP (When Not Observable)

**1. Adjusted Market Assessment**
- Competitor analysis for similar services
- Market rates for implementation services
- Industry benchmarks for support pricing

**2. Expected Cost Plus Margin**
- Installation: Direct costs + target margin
- Support: Annual service costs + profit margin
- License: Development costs allocation + margin

**3. Residual Approach**
- Use only when SSP is highly variable or uncertain
- Typically applied to license component
- Total contract price minus other observable SSPs

## Key ASC 606 Considerations

### Performance Obligation Identification

**Installation Service:**
- ✅ Distinct service (specialized implementation)
- ✅ Customer benefits from service on its own
- ✅ Separable from other obligations

**Software License:**
- ✅ Distinct right (functional software)
- ✅ Customer controls the license
- ✅ Right to use vs. right to access analysis

**Support Services:**
- ✅ Distinct service (ongoing technical support)
- ✅ Stand-ready obligation
- ✅ Series of distinct services (daily support)

### Revenue Recognition Timing

**Point in Time (Installation & License):**
- Customer gains control of the asset/service
- Risks and rewards transfer to customer
- Customer accepts the deliverable
- Entity has right to payment

**Over Time (Support):**
- Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits
- Entity's performance creates no alternative use asset
- Enforceable right to payment for performance to date
